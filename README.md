# GraphQL Basics

### What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.


### Pillars of GraphQL

- Mutaions
- Subscriptions
